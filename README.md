This is my third project. I decided to make this because it was a challenge in one of my tutorials. The challenge was to create a noragami fox using HTML and CSS. This took me a long time but I ended up getting it to work with some help online. I used HTML to arrange the classes. I used CSS for almost everything, created a lot of classes for every part of the fox. I had a lot of fun creating this. Easily my favorite project.
